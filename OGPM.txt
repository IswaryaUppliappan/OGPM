
When testing to be done ?

 It is always better to test the application from the beginning of SDLC rather than waiting for the testing phase.
 Testing to be done when test plan, test cases etc are written and approved
 Once the build is given to QA team to test
 When test data is ready,testing can be done .

Why testing of an application is required?

1. The testing is important since it discovers defects/bugs before the delivery to the client, 
   which guarantees the quality of the software.
2. It makes the software more reliable and easy to use.
3. Thoroughly tested software ensures reliable and high-performance software operations.
4. To identify defects
5. To reduce flaws in the component or system
6. Increase the overall quality of the system
